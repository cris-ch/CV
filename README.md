## Cristian M. Christensen

8 years ago, and with no previous experience in the field, I started a company to extract clay from a quarry.
2 million tons of clay (and challenges) later, I reached a pleateau and decided to take on an exciting new opportunity and started working in logistics & procurement for one of the world’s leading greentech company.
Now I’m looking forward to becoming a developer since I love working on projects and seeing them come to life.
